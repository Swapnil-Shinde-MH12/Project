# Monte Carlo Simulation on Barrier Option Pricing using openACC
Project Overview

Objective: To implement and accelerate a Monte Carlo simulation for pricing barrier options using OpenACC, a directive-based parallel programming model for GPU and multi-core CPU acceleration.
1. Understanding Barrier Options

Barrier options are a type of exotic option whose payoff depends on whether the underlying assetâ€™s price reaches a certain barrier level during the option's life. Common types include:

    Knock-In Options: Become active when the barrier is breached.
    Knock-Out Options: Become void if the barrier is breached.

2. Monte Carlo Simulation for Option Pricing

Monte Carlo simulations involve generating a large number of random paths for the underlying asset's price and computing the average payoff to estimate the option price.
3. Setting Up the Project
